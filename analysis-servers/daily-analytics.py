
# ?Description: 
# !This code defines a web server using the Flask library that receives weather data from a main server via a POST request.
# !The weather data is processed to check if there is any rain during the day, and if so, the name of the city is sent to an
# !alert server using a separate HTTP request. The processed data, including a flag indicating whether it's a rainy day or not,
# !is then returned to the main server as a JSON object.
